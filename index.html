                        <li>Today we got a brief introduction about all the code mentors and classmates in Pink Web Dev </li>
                        <li>We had a theory test regarding html, Git and GitHub. I think it was comforting to se that this 
                            was not only difficult for me but also for my classmates.</li>
                        <li>We got to lean how to install and configure GIT. To add the SHH key. To add and commit our 
                            project so that we can push it.</li> 
                    </ul>
                </td>
                <td>I go home with understanding GIT (version control system) and also GIT-hub. I was afraid before 
                    the class that this would be to difficult for me but do to Kate and other Code-mentors I now understand it. 
                    I think that the first time I saw the lesson-video I was overwhelmed but now that I ”think” that I understand 
                    I will watch it again to really confirm that I understand it.
                </td>
                <td>My homework was to re-watch the videon from lession 1 and 2. I must say that it makes more sense now then the first
                    time I saw the video. So looking forward to continue to the next step!
                    I was also a confirmation of my understanding after passing the course tests.
