                <ul>
                    <li>Today we got a brief introduction about all the code mentors and classmates in Pink Web Dev </li>
                    <li>We had a theory test regarding html, Git and GitHub. I think it was comforting to se that this 
                        was not only difficult for me but also for my classmates.</li>
                    <li>We got to lean how to install and configure GIT. To add the SHH key. To add and commit our 
                        project so that we can push it.</li> 
                </ul>
                <br>
                <b>Learnings:</b> I go home with understanding GIT and also GIT-hub. I was afraid before 
                the class that this would be to difficult for me but do to Kate and other Code-mentors I now understand it. 
                I think that the first time I saw the lesson-video I was overwhelmed but now that I ”think” that I understand 
                I will watch it again to really confirm that I understand it.

            <h2>Homework</h2>
            My homework was to re-watch the videon from lession 1 and 2. I must say that it makes more sense now then the first
            time I saw the video. So looking forward to continue to the next step!
